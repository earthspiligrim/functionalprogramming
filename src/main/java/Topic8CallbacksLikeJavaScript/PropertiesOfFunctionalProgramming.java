    /*

        Pure functional programming has a set of rules to follow
        =============================
        - No state : which means say you have a global variable your function should not depeend on the global variable
        =============================
        - Pure Functions : Functions dont depend on global state impure functions do depend on global state
        =============================
        - No Side Effects : functions should have no side effects other than everything inside of your function body
        =============================
        - Higher Order Functions: A function is considered to be a higer order function if the below two points are met.
        =============================
            * The function takes one or more functions as parameters.
            * The function returns another function as result.
        =============================
